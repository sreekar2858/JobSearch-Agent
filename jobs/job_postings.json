Bei der #d3con in Hamburg ging es um Programmatic, Data und die Zukunft digitaler Werbung – doch das Beste daran? Die echten, persönlichen Begegnungen! Alte Weggefährten, Freunde, neue Kontakte, inspirierende Gespräche. Genau das macht Events wie diese so wertvoll. Nach all den Insights ging’s für mich noch auf eine Runde um die Alster – ohne Handy, nur mit dem Sonnenuntergang als Begleitung. Ein guter Reminder: So digital unsere Welt auch ist, manchmal ist es wichtig, einfach mal offline zu sein. Ich komme immer gerne nach Hamburg ⚓ – privat wie beruflich. Danke an alle für den Austausch & bis zum nächsten Mal! 🚀 👥 🏃 ☀️  #Networking #Programmatic #OfflineMomente #WetterOnline",
