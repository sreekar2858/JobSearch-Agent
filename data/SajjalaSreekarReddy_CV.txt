Work Experience
Siemens Energy 	Mulheim an der Ruhr, Germany
Aero-design Engineer [Internship + Thesis] 	Oct 2023 - Jul 2024
•	Objective: Minimize boundary layer flashback in a 100% hydrogen fueled industrial gas turbine using Generative AI
•	Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop an AI model that predicts combustion results, achieving a 95% match with full-scale simulations
•	Automated Star-CCM+ combustion workflows using Python and Java, cutting simulation runtimes by 12x (from hours to minutes) and accelerating design iterations
•	Successfully deployed two generative AI models on cloud to create novel design configurations, effectively reducing flashback propensity to below 5%
RWTH	Aachen, Germany
Graduate Student Research Assistant 	Aug 2021 - Dec 2024
•	Created an adjoint-based topology optimization solver in OpenFOAM for thermal CFD and integrated surrogate AI model cutting the solver runtime from ~3hrs to ~6secs
•	Implemented a parallel DLCA algorithm in C++ for aerogel geometry creation, achieving over 3x performance improvements with better accuracy. Automated FEM simulations on ABAQUS with python scripts
•	Modernized examination software by migrating it to Python, significantly enhancing functionality and user experience
Volocopter GmbH↗ 	Bruchsal, Germany
Thermal/ Thermo-Mechanical Engineer [Intern] 	 Feb 2023 - Aug 2023
•	Optimized CFRP components and battery pack using high-fidelity simulations, achieving weight reduction and improved thermal efficiency with Optistruct & STAR-CCM+
•	Enhanced battery pack stability and vibration resistance by refining natural frequencies through modal analysis, lowering deviation by 7Hz
•	Advanced safety and regulatory compliance by assessing thermal runaway stresses across multiple battery configurations that align with EU regulations
Digital Additive Production 	Aachen, Germany
Academic Researcher 	Jun 2022 - Feb 2023
•	Aim: Design a topology-agnostic Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict flow fields with accuracy analogous to OpenFOAM simulations
•	Derived a GNN architecture for 3D flow field prediction on tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes, ensuring geometry independence
•	Reduced error rates by 18% through hyperparameter tuning, enhancing model generalization and reliability
•	Achieved 92% accuracy, with predictions close to high-fidelity turbulent flow simulations
Upwork 	Remote
CAE Engineer 	Mar 2019 – Aug 2020
•	Spearheaded design, simulation, and toolchain development for 28 industrial projects, consistently meeting tight deadlines
•	Collaborated with clients all across the world to refine product designs and CAE analysis (FEM, CFD, and FSI), ensuring solutions met precise project specifications
