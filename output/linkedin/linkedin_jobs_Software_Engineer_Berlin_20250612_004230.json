You'll use advanced AI coding tools to quickly turn ideas—expressed in natural language—into functional software prototypes and immersive XR experiences. This is not a traditional coding role. Instead, it's ideal for someone who enjoys working with AI (LLMs), experimenting in tools like Replit, and building intuitive, vibe-based applications.\n\nKey Responsibilities\nUse AI-powered coding assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) to build and refine software based on natural language input.\nCollaborate with designers, developers, and product managers to clarify concepts and rapidly develop working prototypes.\nCreate and fine-tune immersive XR experiences, including Unity-based environments.\nDesign and implement intuitive, user-friendly interfaces with a strong eye for UI/UX.\nWork on both front-end and back-end components in web and interactive applications.\nCommunicate clearly and openly with both technical and non-technical team members.\nStay current with advancements in AI-driven development and XR technology.\nIterate quickly based on user feedback and internal testing.\n\nRequired Qualifications\nSolid computer literacy and problem-solving ability.\nExperience using AI-based coding tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, etc.).\nBasic web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend frameworks a plus).\nFamiliarity with Unity and XR development environments.\nExperience with version control systems (Git) for collaborative development and code management.\nA good feel for design and user experience, even if not formally trained.\nStrong communication and collaboration skills—you're easy to work with.\nSelf-motivated and comfortable navigating ambiguity or incomplete specs.\nPortfolio, GitHub, or links to vibe-based projects (especially with AI or XR) are a strong plus.\n\nPreferred (but not strictly required)\nBackground in immersive learning, education tech, or interactive media design.\n\nWhat We Offer\nA chance to work on the cutting edge of AI and immersive tech.\nA creative, fast-paced environment where ideas are rapidly turned into reality.\nA collaborative international team with strong innovation culture.\nRoom to grow professionally and make real impact.\nCompetitive salary and benefits.\n\nHow to Apply\nPlease submit your resume and a short cover letter. If you have links to projects or vibe-coded experiences—especially using AI tools and/or XR—we'd love to see them.\n\nEON Reality is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to an inclusive workplace.",

We offer mentorship, feedback and proven processes, but it’s your drive and curiosity that will make the difference.\n\nFrom Rookie to Rocky: No previous experience? No problem. We value humility, hard work and a commitment to self-improvement over a packed résumé.\n\nFamiliarity with JavaScript and/or TypeScript: Whether you’re an expert or just starting out, we care about your ability to learn and grow. If we like your application, you’ll receive a coding challenge to demonstrate your skills. Don’t worry if you’re new to our tech stack—some of our best hires started from scratch and excelled by showing dedication and adaptability.\n\nStrong English Skills: You can communicate effectively with the team in English.

Contributions can include comments, commits, pull requests, issues, or anything else that showcases your engagement and skills. Please include your expected period of study here!",
