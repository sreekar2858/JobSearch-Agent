Een vrije en verantwoordelijke rol in een omgeving waar je omringt bent door moderne techniek!De functieJij maakt Quooker      Omdat jij met jouw ervaring machinebouwprojecten van A tot Z kunt begeleiden en het projectteam helder aanstuurt.Met jouw technisch inzicht waardoor jij functionele en maakbare machineontwerpen oplevert.Want als ervaren mentor die actief bijdraagt aan kennisdeling til jij het niveau van jouw collega engineers naar een hoger niveau!\nAls Senior mechanical engineer stuur jij zelfstandig machinebouwprojecten aan op basis van het eisenpakket en de risico-inventarisatie die je samen met de (interne) opdrachtgever hebt opgesteld. Binnen Quooker bedenken, bouwen en onderhouden we onze machines immers helemaal zelf!In deze functie heb jij een mooie balans tussen jouw rol als zowel Mechanical engineer als Projectmanager machinebouw. Op technisch vlak ben jij namelijk eindverantwoordelijk voor het functioneel ontwerpen en uittekenen van machineonderdelen met behulp van 3D CAD software (Solid works) en verantwoordelijk voor (de kwaliteit van) het technisch dossier. Je zorgt daarbij voor een heldere procesbeschrijving voor de Mechatronica en PLC engineers, zodat de besturing naadloos gaat aansluiten op jouw mechanisch ontwerp. Daarnaast zorg jij als Projectmanager voor een duidelijke opzet en opvolging van een projectplanning, ben jij verantwoordelijk voor projectgebonden inkoop en rapporteer je regelmatig over de voortgang. Als ervaren collega begeleid je de betrokken engineers en ben jij vraagbaak voor andere interne en externe stakeholders. Zo review jij tekeningen op basis van maakbaarheid en functionaliteit en adviseer jij collega’s bij onder andere het selecteren van leveranciers.Een vrije en verantwoordelijke positie in een omgeving waar je omringd bent door moderne technieken die grotendeels door Quooker collega’s zijn ontwikkeld en gebouwd. Wie weet train jij binnenkort Productiemedewerkers over het in gebruik nemen van jouw eigen ontworpen machine, die jij dagelijks ziet opereren in ons machinepark!Over het bedrijfWerken bij QuookerQuooker is op missie om de wereld te veroveren! Ze zijn vastberaden deze missie te laten slagen. Die vastberadenheid bevindt zich al in hun DNA sinds 1970: toen Henri Peteri de eerste kokendwaterkraan uitvond. Zijn idee moest en zou een succes worden. En dat lukte. Je past dus goed bij Quooker als je een aanpakker bent en doorzettingsvermogen hebt. De kraan die alles kan heeft zich ontwikkeld als een onmisbare tool in de keuken. Door hun ambitie om innovatief en orgineel te blijven, voorziet de kraan vandaag de dag niet alleen in 100c kokend water maar ook in gekoeld én bruisend water. Ze bedenken, produceren en verzenden de kraan hier, vanuit Nederland. Alles onder één dak. Ze zijn graag onafhankelijk, houden van korte lijnen en varen hun eigen koers. Iedere collega draagt op unieke wijze bij aan het succes. Ze doen compleet verschillende dingen, maar vormen samen een geheel. Benieuwd naar hun rol, drijfveren en ambities? Hier lees je hun verhalen. De Quooker kraan is uitgevonden om ons dagelijks leven, maar ook het milieu te dienen. Makkelijk voor de mens, vriendelijk voor de planeet. Ze kennen hun verantwoordelijkheid en nemen deze ook.Over jouw teamHet team Mechanical engineering bestaat uit 5 mechanical Engineers, 1 senior mechanical engineer en een Teamlead mechanical engineering. Het team Mechanical engineering is onderdeel van afdeling Engineering, die verantwoordelijk is voor het ontwikkelen, bouwen en verbeteren van de machines in de fabriek van Quooker.
