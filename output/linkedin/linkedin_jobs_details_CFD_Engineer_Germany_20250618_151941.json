As part of our team, you will develop cutting-edge collision avoidance algorithms, enhance space situational awareness, and innovate tools for satellite operators. Your expertise in data science and physics will help us detect, predict, and mitigate orbital risks, ensuring safe and sustainable space exploration.Your Tasks And Responsibilities      You will collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of aerospace engineers, data scientists, and software developers to integrate and optimize third-party sensor data sources within our SSA platform. Your contributions will directly enhance the accuracy, automation, and scalability of our orbital risk management solutions.Integrate third-party data sources into our platform, working closely with providers to seamlessly onboard their data.Develop, implement, and optimize high-precision algorithms for orbit propagation, orbit determination (OD), sensor fusion, covariance modelling, and uncertainty quantification.Develop methods to fuse data from diverse sources into one common image of the space debris environment.Conduct validation and verification (V&V) campaigns to benchmark and refine algorithmic performance against ground truth datasets.Work closely with software engineers to transition prototype algorithms into scalable, production-ready solutions.\nYour profileMust-have      M.Sc. or higher in Aerospace Engineering, Space Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics, or a closely related field, or have prior work experience in the field of SSA/SST or Space Flight Dynamics.A minimum of 2 years of relevant work experience is required. Strong theoretical and practical knowledge of astrodynamics, orbital mechanics, and flight dynamics.Experience in scientific programming using at least one of the following languages: Java, Fortran (90+) or Python.Ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative, and research-driven environment.This position is only open to candidates currently based in Germany or willing to relocate.Valid working permit for Germany/EU.\nNice-to-have:      Hands-on experience with space surveillance and tracking (SST) systems, including sensor tasking and catalog maintenance.Experience working with space agencies or private space companies in the SSA/SST field.Familiarity with space surveillance and tracking systems.Understanding of space policy and compliance frameworks.Experience with AI/ML applications for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, or orbit prediction in SSA applications.Interest in contributing to the sustainability of space and long-term spaceflight operations.\nWhy us?      With a lean hierarchy and small working groups, you define your own way of work including flexible work hours.Work on groundbreaking space sustainability challenges with a team of top-tier engineers and scientists.After your on-boarding time in Braunschweig, you can choose between staying in our office, working remote (within Germany) or a hybrid approach.Enjoy technical freedom. Influence system architecture, research methodologies, and data integration approaches.Grow continuously with access to training budgets, industry conferences, and networking opportunities.Be part of a strong engineering culture, with regular knowledge-sharing sessions, technical deep dives, and innovation sprints.Great team spirit, with company-wide events such as monthly all-hands lunches, and social activities like laser tag, dinners, and team-building outings.\nAbout UsOKAPI:Orbits is at the forefront of space sustainability, addressing some of the most pressing challenges of the space industry: the growing problem of crowded orbital regimes, and the need for more efficient satellite operations. We're providing end-to-end solutions that help various space industry players cover their Space Situation Awareness (SSA), and Space Traffic Management and Coordination (STM & STC) needs. We are committed to safeguarding space missions and access to space for all humanity. Join us on our mission.",

This role focuses on supporting Reduced Order Models (ROM), digital twin technology, and the use of optiSLang for optimizing thermal and mechanical designs. The successful candidate will work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to enhance the design and simulation capabilities of our advanced battery systems.This role is based in Hannover, GermanyKey Responsibilities: What you will doMultiphysics Modeling & Simulation      Perform FEA/CFD analysis using LS-DYNA, ANSYS Workbench, Fluent UDFs, and APDL scripting to model thermal runaway, mechanical stress, and failure modes in lithium-ion batteries. Develop first-principles thermal/electrochemical models for heat generation, thermal gradients, and cooling efficiency under extreme conditions. Simulate mechanical damage (crush, vibration) using fracture mechanics and composite material failure criteria. \nDigital Twin Development:      Support the creation and implementation of digital twins for battery systems to simulate real-world performance and predict outcomes. Ensure digital twins are aligned with performance targets and validated against experimental data. \nDesign Optimization:      Leverage AI/ML tools to optimize design parameters and improve thermal and mechanical performance. Conduct sensitivity analyses and parameter studies to identify critical design variables. \nThermal and Mechanical Design:      Perform thermal and mechanical simulations to assess design feasibility and performance. Collaborate with design engineers to refine and improve designs based on simulation results. \nCollaboration and Reporting:      Work closely with cross-functional teams, including systems engineers and design teams, to align simulation efforts with overall project goals. Document methodologies, simulation results, and optimization strategies, and present findings to technical and non-technical stakeholders. \nKnowledge, Skills and Abilities: What we look forEducation: Master‚Äôs/PhD in Mechanical, Thermal, or Chemical Engineering (or related field).Technical Skills:       Expertise in ANSYS Workbench, LS-DYNA, Fluent UDFs, APDL, or Abaqus.  Proficiency in Python for AI/ML workflows (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).  Strong grasp of battery electrochemistry, thermal runaway mechanisms, and composite materials. \nSoft Skills: Collaborative problem-solving, customer-facing communication, and technical writing.Fluency in English and German.Preferred Skills       Experience with CFD for conjugate heat transfer in battery packs.  Familiarity with 3D CAD tools (SolidWorks, CATIA, spaceclaim, discovery) for geometry preprocessing.
