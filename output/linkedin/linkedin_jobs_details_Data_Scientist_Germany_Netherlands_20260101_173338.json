While nature took billions of years to perfect molecules, we are harnessing AI to unlock trillion-dollar materials breakthroughs in months, not millennia. Our founding team is the most cited in the world, comprised of world-class researchers in AI, chemistry and engineering.We are working on some of the hardest and most important challenges including energy, clean water, the future of compute, and carbon capture, and this is just the start of what our 'search engine' for next-generation materials will unlock.We invite you to be part of a diverse, innovative team at the intersection of AI and materials science, working to create impactful partnerships that drive innovation, scalability, and industry collaboration. This work matters. Your work matters.We’re on the cusp of the on-demand materials era. Join us.The RoleDue to growth, we are seeking an Applied ML Researcher (Molecular Simulation)* to advance our molecular simulation capabilities, developing next-generation computational methods that bridge molecular-scale physics with continuum-level phenomena.      Note that you would be joining as a ‘Member of Technical Staff’, but the indicative job title above hopefully helps to explain the nature of this role. \nHiring timelines: We’re aiming to start interviewing for this role in February and would like to make an offer by the end of March.Your ImpactSimulating how molecules behave under realistic conditions is one of the key bottlenecks in materials discovery. Current tools are either too slow or too approximate, and that limits how quickly we can evaluate candidates and close the loop with experiments.You will build the next generation of simulation methods: fast, accelerator-native, and grounded in rigorous physics.Your work will directly expand what's computationally tractable, letting us ask questions about molecular systems that were previously too expensive to answer. This is foundational infrastructure for everything CuspAI does.What You Will DoSimulation Methodology & Tooling      Design and implement high-performance simulation software in JAX, targeting GPU/TPU-accelerated molecular and continuum-scale methodsDevelop surrogate models and ML-driven acceleration techniques for physics-based simulationsBuild robust, reusable foundation blocks to enable the broader team to iterate rapidly on new scientific problems\nMultiscale Methods      Bridge molecular simulations (MD, Monte Carlo) with continuum-level PDE models, enabling true multiscale workflowsDevelop and refine ML-driven enhanced sampling techniques for challenging molecular systemsConduct fundamental research on developing novel Machine Learning models for coarse-graining molecular data and extracting key parameters for higher-scale simulations\nResearch & Collaboration      Work closely with domain scientists across the organization to ground methods development in real project needsContribute to the scientific direction of the simulation team, identifying high-impact methodological gapsTranslate research advances into production-quality code\nMust Have Skills and Qualifications:      You are motivated by the opportunity to build foundational tools that unlock new capabilities in molecular and materials scienceDemonstrated technical excellence in both research and implementation; you write high-quality, performant code, not just papersExceptional coding skills with a strong command of modern software engineering practices down to compilation levelDeep experience with GPU/TPU-accelerated frameworks (e.g. JAX, PyTorch) for scientific or high-performance computing applicationsPhD (or comparable experience) in a relevant quantitative field (physics, applied mathematics, computational science, machine learning, or similar) with a strong computational mathematics foundations and the ability to apply them to physical systemsStrong understanding of modern ML, particularly as applied to scientific problems\nBonus Points (But Not Critical):      Background in sampling methods (MCMC, molecular dynamics) and statistical mechanicsExperience with molecular simulation packages or developing simulation softwareFamiliarity with multiscale modeling approaches or surrogate/emulator methods for PDEsTrack record of published research at top venues in ML, computational physics, or related fieldsHands-on experience bridging mathematical formulations with efficient low-level implementation, including optimizing at the compiler/CUDA level\nAdditional ConsiderationsThis role could be based in Amsterdam, Berlin, Cambridge or London, with the expectation of being in the office three days per week. Additionally, there may be regular travel required to other locations for collaboration and project work.What we offer      A competitive salary plus equity package so you have a stake in the success of the company28 days holidayProfessional development budget for scientific conferences and technical trainingOpportunity to work at the forefront of AI-driven scientific discovery with world-class researchersDirect impact on advancing materials science through cutting-edge technologyCollaborative environment bridging AI research, computational chemistry, and experimental science\nJoin us in shaping the future of materials with AI.
