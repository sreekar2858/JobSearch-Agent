    "description": "About the job\nAt Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.\n\nTo achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.\n\nFor a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.\n\nA few examples of your responsibilities\nMaster your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.\nBuild stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.\nSimplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.\n\nWhat we look for\nReasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.\nDrive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.\nTeam spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.\nProficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.\nYou can work at least 20 hours per week. A full-time commitment is preferred, but we’ll consider applicants who can commit to at least 20 hours per week.\n\nWhat we offer\nIncredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.\nAn exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.\nCompetitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.\nAll. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.\n\nCommitment & contract\nInternship. Full-time or part-time.\n\nLocation\nMilan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.\n\nBefore you apply\nBending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.\n\nThe selection process\nIf you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.\n\nBending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.\n\nStudies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.\n\nDesired Skills and Experience\nAlgorithms, Attention to Detail, Code Refactoring, Computer Science, Debugging, Optimization, Problem Solving, Reasoning Skills, Software Development, Software Engineers",

    "company": "Wikimedia Deutschland e. V.",
    "description": "About the job\nFree knowledge leads to a fairer world. Wikipedia is the most important online knowledge collection of our time. The German Wikipedia alone records almost 1 billion page views per month for a total of 3 million articles. We - Wikimedia Deutschland e. V. - support the volunteers of Wikipedia and its sister projects, develop free software, such as Wikidata, and advocate for free access to knowledge, the opening of education and research, and more common good orientation in data policy.\n\nWe are looking for a Software Engineer (all genders) (30-40 hours/week) to join and support one of our agile development teams. This is a permanent contract starting as soon as possible and this position is based in our headquarter in Berlin.\n\nAbout the position & the team:\n\nYou will be working with the team that develops and improves the software behind the Wikidata project. Wikidata is a free and open knowledge graph that can be read and edited by both humans and machines and is a part of the Linked Open Data Network. You will be developing open source software that puts user needs first and increases users’ satisfaction. Wikidata has the clear goal of giving more people more access to more knowledge and you will be part of that!\n\nTechnologies we use:\n\nMost of our server side code is written in PHP and extends the functionality of MediaWiki. For version control we use Git. We use Vue.js and TypeScript for our modern frontends. We also keep migrating our legacy code into these and newer technologies. Also, testing is important to us; we use testing frameworks and practice continuous integration across our projects.\n\nKnowledge and experience in these technologies is not a requirement. We believe they all can be learned on the job and WMDE, your team, and your line manager will support you in this learning.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing: \n\nAmong your tasks there will be the following:\n\nBuild and maintain the functionality of Wikidata and its associated tools, collaborating with the team on finding the best solution to user problems. \nParticipate in all the stages of software development as well as code, design, and do code reviews providing constructive feedback. \nMaintain a good understanding of the technical aspects of the product roadmap as well as the team goals. \nEngage in constantly improving the team processes and agile practices. \n\nWhat makes you right for this role: \n\nYou are passionate and care about software. \nYour background is not important as long as you have a solid understanding and experience with object oriented programming (ideally PHP) and web development. \nYou have an eye for software design and quality and you understand the importance of tests. \nYou like working in a team working towards a common goal, learning together, and supporting and lifting up your peers. \nYou are not afraid of making mistakes, you want to keep learning and developing yourself. \nYou are passionate about Wikimedia’s mission and want to make an impact towards our goal of giving more people more access to free knowledge. \nYou are able to communicate in English with professional proficiency. \n\n Interested? \n\nPlease send us your detailed application documents (Resume & Motivational Letter (yes, we read them)) via our job portal. We kindly ask you to refrain from application photos and information on date of birth, marital status and parents.\n\nWikimedia Germany is committed to equal opportunities and does not discriminate on the basis of, for example, ethnic origin, citizenship, religion or belief, political or other convictions, gender, age, disability, or sexual identity. We would like to address you in the way which feels most comfortable for you so please share your preferred name and pronouns if you wish.",
